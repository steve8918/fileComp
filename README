Program to do a byte-by-byte comparison between two directories.

I know it's been done before, but I wanted to write something that 
does it the way that I want.  Specifically, this is used by me to
verify my backups that I do to external USB drives.  After doing a copy
the hard drive and the OS can both confirm that the data was written
correctly, but the data could actually be written incorrectly.  When
dealing with terabytes of data, especially with my 200 GB databases 
of stock data, I didn't want to risk it, so I thought I would
just create something really basic that would recurse through
the directories and do a byte-by-byte comparison. 

I suppose I could have used some form of find and cmp, but this
was interesting to me so I figured why not.

There's still a lot I need to do to clean this code up, it's
pretty rough, but it works.  I figured I might as well dump it up 
since I may or may not revisit this, since my goal was to get it
working over the New Year's weekend.
